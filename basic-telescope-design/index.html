<p><strong>Basic Telescope Design</strong>. The observatorys main instrument was the Arecibo Telescope a 305 m 1000 ft spherical reflector dish built. The best telescope is the one used often to enjoy the beauty and intrigue of the night sky. The Arecibo Observatory also known as the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center NAIC and formerly known as the Arecibo Ionosphere Observatory is an observatory in Barrio Esperanza Arecibo Puerto Rico owned by the US National Science Foundation NSF. It is 60 at the moment and comes free with the Z8.</p>

<p>The best telescope is the one used often to enjoy the beauty and intrigue of the night sky. It is 60 at the moment and comes free with the Z8. A Dobsonian Telescope also widely known as Newtonian Telescope was designed by John Dobson in the year 1965. The telescope is altazimuth-mounted and operates at low magnifications. Collimating the telescope is an essential part of observations and you have to do it frequently. The design favored amateur astronomers as it was a simplified version of the extremely technical telescope designs.</p>
