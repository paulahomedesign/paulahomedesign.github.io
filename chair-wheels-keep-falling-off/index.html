<p>You get used to this chair after a week. However paying thousands of dollars later in medical bills and having a bad back later in life is much worse. The goal is to prevent injuries from falling down or from objects that might fall or be thrown at you. Protect your head and neck with a large book a pillow or your arms. This chair is going to train you to have good posture after just a little bit of time and at first it might feel weird.</p>

<p>You get used to this chair after a week. However paying thousands of dollars later in medical bills and having a bad back later in life is much worse. Remove any items that are not securely attached to the wheelchair. The goal is to prevent injuries from falling down or from objects that might fall or be thrown at you. Adjustable arm height is amazing for comfort mesh back keeps me from sweating and the lumbar support feels great.</p>
