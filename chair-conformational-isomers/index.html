<p><strong>Chair Conformational Isomers</strong>. Where K is the equilibrium constant ΔG is the difference in standard free energy between the two conformers in kcalmol R is the universal. The chair conformer of the cis 12-dichloro isomer is chiral. Both the chlorine and methyl groups may assume an equatorial orientation in a chair conformation of the trans-isomer as shown in the top equation. The cis isomer is a diastereomer of the trans isomers.</p>

<p>Finally all of these isomers may exist as a mixture of two or more conformational isomers as shown in the table. The chair conformer of the cis 12-dichloro isomer is chiral. Since the reaction between a carboxylic acid and an amine to give an amide also liberates water this is an example of a condensation reaction. Amides are carboxylic acid derivatives where the OH of the carboxylic acid has been replaced by NH 2 NHR or NR 2 of an amine. A similar analysis of the 1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane isomers explains both the rate and regioselectivity differences. Its called the S N 2 reaction and its going to be extremely useful for us going forward.</p>

<p>The chair conformer of the cis 12-dichloro isomer is chiral. A similar analysis of the 1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane isomers explains both the rate and regioselectivity differences. Finally all of these isomers may exist as a mixture of two or more conformational isomers as shown in the table. Having gone through the two different types of substitution reactions and talked about nucleophiles and electrophiles were finally in a position to reveal the mechanism for one of the most important reactions in organic chemistry. Its called the S N 2 reaction and its going to be extremely useful for us going forward.</p>

<p>The SN2 Reaction Mechanism. Amides are carboxylic acid derivatives where the OH of the carboxylic acid has been replaced by NH 2 NHR or NR 2 of an amine. The chair conformer of the cis 12-dichloro isomer is chiral. Conformational isomers exist in a dynamic equilibrium where the relative free energies of isomers determines the population of each isomer and the energy barrier of rotation determines the rate of interconversion between isomers. Where K is the equilibrium constant ΔG is the difference in standard free energy between the two conformers in kcalmol R is the universal.</p>

<p>The cis isomer is a diastereomer of the trans isomers. A similar analysis of the 1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane isomers explains both the rate and regioselectivity differences. Finally all of these isomers may exist as a mixture of two or more conformational isomers as shown in the table. The chair conformer of the cis 12-dichloro isomer is chiral. Both the chlorine and methyl groups may assume an equatorial orientation in a chair conformation of the trans-isomer as shown in the top equation.</p>
