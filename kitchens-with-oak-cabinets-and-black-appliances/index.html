<p>White Kitchen Cabinet Black Granite Countertop Island. I picked a black granite that has long white streaks in it and the island and desk will be a sheet black stain. Additionally the crown molding is dark wood. Throw the rulebook out of the window in favor of unexpected paint-color pairings. Throughout the 1980s and 90s oak was a popular choice for kitchen cabinetry in homes across America and this cabinet material remains in many homes today.</p>

<p>Ok Im new at this. There are 7 doors and 3 windows in the room that are all dark wood with dark wood trim. I have a fairly large kitchen with lots of solid honey oak Shaker-style cabinets. The island is 12 feet long and has honey oak cabinets on both sides the gas cooktop is in the island. White cabinets with white appliances are the ultimate combo for a clean seamless look.</p>

<p>By choosing a light neutral tone you dont have to worry about drawing attention away from the bold appealing look of the black appliances. Pale oak floors have a scrubbed look and plank cabinetry with painted hinges and black latches give a kitchen old-time charm. But you really cant go wrong with a simple elongated subway tile. I have a fairly large kitchen with lots of solid honey oak Shaker-style cabinets. From classic white cream black and grey units to contemporary hues of blue green and red let your personality shine through with the perfect shade.</p>
