<p><strong>Aircraft Wing Design Calculations</strong>. The FR-1 Fireball equipped a single squadron before the wars end but did not see combat. In the early stages of design it is therefore advisable to follow the designs of successful aircraft models. 7 Wing Design During the preliminary sizing the wing was merely described in terms of the wing area SW and the wing aspect ratio AW. Of all the nations Germany was the first to begin to make significant use of jet aircraft although these nevertheless came too late in the war and in insufficient quantity to have a decisive effect on the course of the air war.</p>
