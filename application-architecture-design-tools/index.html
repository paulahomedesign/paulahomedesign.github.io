<p>There are two main differences. The web applications as described in my previous article have their own user interface. An application architecture describes the patterns and techniques used to design and build an application. N-tier application architecture provides. The architecture of cloud-native applications or microservices has many similarities to the Architecture of Web Applications which I wrote about in my previous article from this series. Software design patterns can help you to build an application.</p>

<p>Enterprise architecture is a different topic how to organize multiple applications in an enterprise into a coherent whole. An application architecture describes the patterns and techniques used to design and build an application.
