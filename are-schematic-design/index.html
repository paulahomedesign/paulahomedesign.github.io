<p>This is done interactively with the help of a schematic capture tool also known as schematic editor. Schematic is one of the important aspects of PCB designA good schematic shows a well-structured circuit diagram clearly depicting the electrical connections between various electronic componentsIt should also be noted that a technically correct but crowded schematic is still a bad one as it might confuse. Schematic capture or schematic entry is a step in the design cycle of electronic design automation EDA at which the electronic diagram or electronic schematic of the designed electronic circuit is created by a designer. However there is often some confusion as to what schematic design really means. What is the importance of a schematic diagram.</p>
