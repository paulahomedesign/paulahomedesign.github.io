<p><strong>Dust Bowl Soil Erosion</strong>. It is estimated to have displaced 300 thousand tons of topsoil from the prairie area. The soil erosion that resulted from growing crops on steeper and steeper slopes lowered soil productivity - both in the hills and in the valleys - to a point where the populations could no longer survive in that area. Windborne topsoil may be transported. Soil erosion is the washing or blowing away by water or wind of the top layer of soil dirt.</p>

<p>The Great Plains Shelterbelt was a project to create windbreaks in the Great Plains states of the United States that began in 1934. The soil erosion that resulted from growing crops on steeper and steeper slopes lowered soil productivity - both in the hills and in the valleys - to a point where the populations could no longer survive in that area. At the same time the climatic effects all but dried up an already depressed American economy in. A USDA-National Resources Inventory report shows soil erosion rates on cropland decreased 35 from 1982 to 2017. Thats what really happened during the Dust Bowl.</p>
