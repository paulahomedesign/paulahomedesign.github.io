<p>As their name implies a Binary Subtractor is a decision making circuit that subtracts two binary numbers from each other for example X Y to find the resulting difference between the two numbers. This circuit can be done with two half-Subtractor circuits. Submitted by Saurabh Gupta on January 23 2020. This circuit is used to subtract two binary values A and B that are both single bits. The circuit diagram of the full subtractor using basic gates is shown in the following block diagram.</p>

<p>The subtractor is one of the types of the combinational arithmetic circuit that generates an output which is the subtraction of two binary numbers. The subtractor is one of the types of the combinational arithmetic circuit that generates an output which is the subtraction of two binary numbers. In this tutorial we are going to learn about the N-bit Parallel Adders 4-bit Binary Adder and Subtractor in Digital Electronics. Till now we have already read in the previous articles about designing and uses of the basic form of adders and subtractors such as Half Adder Full Adder Half Subtractor and Full. A full subtractor is a combinational circuit that performs subtraction of two bits one is minuend and other is subtrahend taking into account borrow of the previous adjacent lower minuend bit.</p>
