A failed engagement forces 43-year-old Lindsey Dell back to her hometown and back to her best friend Cameron one of the areas top. Katie designed the perfect kitchen which is functional and beautiful. The cookbook recipes have all the great character and flavors of the restaurant yet most of them are approachable in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The cabinets were pre-built a few arrived damaged and the staff was on top of it and got them replaced ASAP to keep our project on timeline. As your kitchen designer and cabinet maker we believe that the kitchen is the heart of the home. Get Katies recipes and watch highlights from the show on Food Network. Kitchen Bath Remodelers. We love our new kitchen and Katie has done a fabulous job of designing the kitchen we dreamed of.</p>
