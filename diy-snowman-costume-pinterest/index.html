<p>I got a request from Abigail asking for some Cardboard handmade Christmas ornaments and you know how I am to serve. Handmade Christmas Ornaments dont need to look cheap or homemade. Here are several beautiful Christmas ornaments to make using cardboard that would make pretty Christmas tree decorations and gift toppers. This snowman is really cool as well because both his head and body were actually put together using plastic cups. All of its features are 3D much like youd see in a real snowman and it shines from the inside which means it has some kind of light source in its lower body.</p>
