<p><strong>Garage Door Rust Hole Repair</strong>. If you get that rust on top of the chrome its obviously because the chrome has a hole in it to allow the rust out. The lift is the amount of weight that each spring can raise off the ground As a result a properly operating garage door with the right springs should not seem to weigh nearly as much as the garage door itself. Chrome is a coating so it is the metal underneath that is rusting. If you have deep rust then maybe not clearing it all up but its meant for surface rust and sealing the holes that allow the rust to come through the chrome.</p>

If you get that rust on top of the chrome its obviously because the chrome has a hole in it to allow the rust out. The lift is the amount of weight that each spring can raise off the ground As a result a properly operating garage door with the right springs should not seem to weigh nearly as much as the garage door itself.</p>

<p>If you get that rust on top of the chrome its obviously because the chrome has a hole in it to allow the rust out. If you have deep rust then maybe not clearing it all up but its meant for surface rust and sealing the holes that allow the rust to come through the chrome. Chrome is a coating so it is the metal underneath that is rusting. The lift is the amount of weight that each spring can raise off the ground As a result a properly operating garage door with the right springs should not seem to weigh nearly as much as the garage door itself. Instead the garage door weight slightly exceeds the lift produced by the torsion springs.</p>
