<p>Atomic absorption analysis involves measuring the absorption of light by vaporized ground state atoms and relating the absorption to concentration. It involves using a beam of light usually ultraviolet light that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light. Atomization of the sample. The incident light beam is attenuated by atomic vapor absorption according to Beers law. Atomic absorption analysis involves measuring the absorption of light by vaporized ground state atoms and relating the absorption to concentration.</p>
