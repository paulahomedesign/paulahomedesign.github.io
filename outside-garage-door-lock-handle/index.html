After a break in due to my own stupidity I purchased this garage door lock set to enable locking unlocking from the outside for an old steel panel garage door that only secured from inside. Includes Door Lock which ensures no one can open the door from the outside without first pulling the release handle on the inside.</p>

<p>Even still once a burglar has access to your garage and lowers the garage door quickly they have plenty of time to bypass the door lock. After a break in due to my own stupidity I purchased this garage door lock set to enable locking unlocking from the outside for an old steel panel garage door that only secured from inside. As a preventative measure its smart to keep a spare key or install an emergency key release that would allow you to release the emergency disconnect to the operator so you can manually raise. If the garage door is the only way in or out or if you cant find the key to the door youll have to either find a way to break in or call a locksmith. There is a very small piece of cheap metal that engages on the handle when locked.</p>
