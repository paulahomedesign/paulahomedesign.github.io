<p>During system implementation it is important to clarify the different states of the object during its lifetime. The users must know the main objective of a computer application early in the analysis for a successful design and conversion. Our project need four activity diagrams because there are different parts and flows of system. It defines the state of the components and state changes triggered by an event. UML models basically three types of diagrams namely structure diagrams interaction diagrams and behavior diagrams.</p>
